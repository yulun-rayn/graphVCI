## Procedure

A clean example of data preparation can be found in [SciplexPrep.ipynb](datasets/SciplexPrep.ipynb). For an example of data preparation on a messier dataset with thorough analysis and visualizations, see [MarsonPrep.ipynb](datasets/MarsonPrep.ipynb).

In summary, the preparation procedure includes:

-   Quality Control

-   Normalization

-   Gene Selection

-   Field Specification

-   (Optional) Dataset Split

-   (Optional) Out-of-distribution Selection

-   (Optional) Differentially-expressed Gene Ranking
